*The LeverageRouter contract is an immutable periphery contract that facilitates the use of Morpho flash loans and a swap adapter
to mint and redeem equity from LeverageTokens.
The high-level mint flow is as follows:
1. The user calls `mint` with the amount of equity to mint LeverageTokens (shares) for, the minimum amount of shares to receive, the maximum
cost to the sender for the swap of debt to collateral during the mint to help repay the flash loan, and the swap context.
2. The LeverageRouter will flash loan the required collateral asset from Morpho.
3. The LeverageRouter will use the flash loaned collateral and the equity from the sender for the mint into the LeverageToken,
receiving LeverageTokens and debt in return.
4. The LeverageRouter will swap the debt received from the mint to the collateral asset.
5. The LeverageRouter will use the swapped assets to repay the flash loan along with the collateral asset from the sender
(the maximum swap cost)
6. The LeverageRouter will transfer the LeverageTokens and any remaining collateral asset to the sender.
The high-level redeem flow is the same as the mint flow, but in reverse.*


## State Variables
### leverageManager
The LeverageManager contract


```solidity
ILeverageManager public immutable leverageManager;
```


### morpho
The Morpho core protocol contract


```solidity
IMorpho public immutable morpho;
```


### swapper
The swap adapter contract used to facilitate swaps


```solidity
ISwapAdapter public immutable swapper;
```


## Functions
### constructor

Creates a new LeverageRouter


```solidity
constructor(ILeverageManager _leverageManager, IMorpho _morpho, ISwapAdapter _swapper);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_leverageManager`|`ILeverageManager`|The LeverageManager contract|
|`_morpho`|`IMorpho`|The Morpho core protocol contract|
|`_swapper`|`ISwapAdapter`|The Swapper contract|


### mint

Mint shares of a LeverageToken by adding equity

*Flash loans the collateral required to add the equity to the LeverageToken, receives debt, then swaps the debt to the
LeverageToken's collateral asset. The swapped assets and the sender's supplied collateral are used to repay the flash loan*


```solidity
function mint(
    ILeverageToken token,
    uint256 equityInCollateralAsset,
    uint256 minShares,
    uint256 maxSwapCostInCollateralAsset,
    ISwapAdapter.SwapContext memory swapContext
) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`token`|`ILeverageToken`|LeverageToken to mint shares of|
|`equityInCollateralAsset`|`uint256`|The amount of equity to mint LeverageToken shares for. Denominated in the collateral asset of the LeverageToken|
|`minShares`|`uint256`|Minimum shares (LeverageTokens) to receive from the mint|
|`maxSwapCostInCollateralAsset`|`uint256`|The maximum amount of collateral from the sender to use to help repay the flash loan due to the swap of debt to collateral being unfavorable|
|`swapContext`|`ISwapAdapter.SwapContext`|Swap context to use for the swap (which DEX to use, the route, tick spacing, etc.)|


### redeem

Redeems equity of a LeverageToken by repaying debt and burning shares


```solidity
function redeem(
    ILeverageToken token,
    uint256 equityInCollateralAsset,
    uint256 maxShares,
    uint256 maxSwapCostInCollateralAsset,
    ISwapAdapter.SwapContext memory swapContext
) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`token`|`ILeverageToken`|LeverageToken to redeem|
|`equityInCollateralAsset`|`uint256`|The amount of equity to receive by redeeming LeverageToken. Denominated in the collateral asset of the LeverageToken|
|`maxShares`|`uint256`|Maximum shares (LeverageTokens) to redeem|
|`maxSwapCostInCollateralAsset`|`uint256`|The maximum amount of equity to pay for the redeem of the LeverageToken to use to help repay the debt flash loan due to the swap of debt to collateral being unfavorable|
|`swapContext`|`ISwapAdapter.SwapContext`|Swap context to use for the swap (which DEX to use, the route, tick spacing, etc.)|


### onMorphoFlashLoan

Morpho flash loan callback function


```solidity
function onMorphoFlashLoan(uint256 loanAmount, bytes calldata data) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`loanAmount`|`uint256`|Amount of asset flash loaned|
|`data`|`bytes`|Encoded data passed to `morpho.flashLoan`|


### _mintAndRepayMorphoFlashLoan

Executes the mint of a LeverageToken and the swap of debt assets to the collateral asset
to repay the flash loan from Morpho


```solidity
function _mintAndRepayMorphoFlashLoan(MintParams memory params, uint256 collateralLoanAmount) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`params`|`MintParams`|Params for the mint into a LeverageToken|
|`collateralLoanAmount`|`uint256`|Amount of collateral asset flash loaned|


### _redeemAndRepayMorphoFlashLoan

Executes redeem on a LeverageToken to receive equity and the swap of collateral assets to the debt asset
to repay the flash loan from Morpho


```solidity
function _redeemAndRepayMorphoFlashLoan(RedeemParams memory params, uint256 debtLoanAmount) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`params`|`RedeemParams`|Params for the redeem of equity from a LeverageToken|
|`debtLoanAmount`|`uint256`|Amount of debt asset flash loaned|
