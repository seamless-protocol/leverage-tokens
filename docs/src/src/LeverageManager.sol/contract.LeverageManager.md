*The LeverageManager contract is an upgradeable core contract that is responsible for managing the creation of LeverageTokens.
It also acts as an entry point for users to mint and redeem LeverageTokens (shares), and for
rebalancers to rebalance LeverageTokens.
LeverageTokens are ERC20 tokens that are akin to shares in an ERC-4626 vault - they represent a claim on the equity held by
the LeverageToken. They can be created on this contract by calling `createNewLeverageToken`, and their configuration on the
LeverageManager is immutable.
Note: Although the LeverageToken configuration saved on the LeverageManager is immutable, the configured LendingAdapter and
RebalanceAdapter for the LeverageToken may be upgradeable contracts.
The LeverageManager also inherits the `FeeManager` contract, which is used to manage LeverageToken fees (which accrue to
the share value of the LeverageToken) and the treasury fees.
For mints of LeverageTokens (shares), the collateral and debt required is calculated by using the LeverageToken's
current collateral ratio. As such, the collateral ratio after a mint must be equal to the collateral ratio before a
mint, within some rounding error.
[CAUTION]
====
- LeverageTokens are susceptible to inflation attacks like ERC-4626 vaults:
"In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, mints are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning
with a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation
attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial
mint of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Redeems may
similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by
verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as
https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router]."
As such it is highly recommended that LeverageToken creators make an initial mint of a non-trivial amount of equity.
It is also recommended to use a router that performs slippage checks when minting and redeeming.
- LeverageToken creation is permissionless and can be configured with arbitrary lending adapters, rebalance adapters, and
underlying collateral and debt assets. As such, the adapters and tokens used by a LeverageToken are part of the risk
profile of the LeverageToken, and should be carefully considered by users before using a LeverageToken.
- LeverageTokens can be configured with arbitrary lending adapters, thus LeverageTokens are directly affected by the
specific mechanisms of the underlying lending market that their lending adapter integrates with. As mentioned above,
it is highly recommended that users research and understand the lending adapter used by the LeverageToken they are
considering using. Some examples:
- Morpho: Users should be aware that Morpho market creation is permissionless, and that the price oracle used by
by the market may be manipulatable.
- Aave v3: Allows rehypothecation of collateral, which may lead to reverts when trying to remove collateral from the
market during redeems and rebalances.*
